#  Band Gap Prediction of Perovskite Oxides using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution to predict the **band gap (Eg)** of **Perovskite oxides**, a class of materials critical to next-generation electronics like solar cells, LEDs, and semiconductors.

##  Problem Statement

Perovskite oxides have tunable electronic properties, and accurately predicting their band gap helps in material discovery for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Traditional methods can be slow and computationally expensive, so this project uses machine learning to predict band gaps quickly and efficiently.
